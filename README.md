# Student Behavior Detector in Classroom

This repository provides resources and links for the Student Behavior Detector project, which aims to identify and analyze student behavior in classroom settings using advanced computer vision models.

## Blog

For a detailed overview and insights about the project, read our blog post on Medium (Thai):
- [Student Behavior Detector in Classroom](https://medium.com/@nontaphatfirm/student-behavior-detector-in-classroom-20f2fe5cc8a3)

## Dataset

We utilized a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating our models. The dataset is available in two formats:
- **Original Dataset** : [SCB-dataset on GitHub](https://github.com/Whiffe/SCB-dataset)
- **Splitted Data (recommend)** : [Detecting Student Classroom Behavior on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nonpat/detecting-student-classroom-behavior2)

## Model

Our project leverages state-of-the-art models for object detection:
- **Yolov8x** : [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics)
- **Yolov9e** : [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov9)
- **Yolov10x** : [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10)

Trained models are available here:
- **Trained Models** : [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nonpat/test010/data)

## Deployment

You can try the Student Behavior Detector yourself through our deployment on Hugging Face Spaces (Note: Video is not supported yet):
